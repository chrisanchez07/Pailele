# Pailele

Pailele is a robot with a structure based on the pololu line follower. Its design is smaller and ligther though, and implements an improved PID control making it faster and more agile for tracks with small radious (under 10 cm).

The programm is written in C for an 8 -bit microcontrolles from NXP (MC9S08JM60) which uses a TTL level voltage configuration which allows to improve the input sensors sensitivity using a higher voltage than CMOS microcontrollers.

The Robot has participated in some robotics competitions in Colombia around 2012 and has won a second place.

I hope some robotics and line follower entusiasts find this repository useful for future projects and devlepoments.
